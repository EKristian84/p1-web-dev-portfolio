# Welcome to Your Project Hub! ðŸŽ“

Hello and welcome! This space is dedicated to helping you submit all your project smoothly and efficiently. To ensure everything runs like clockwork, we've put together a simple guide. Following these steps will help us all maintain a tidy and structured repository, making the submission process a breeze for everyone involved.

## ðŸ¦® Step-by-Step Submission Guidelines

### Pick the Right Branch

- **Branch Selection:** For each assignment, you'll be given a specific branch name that's closely related to your project's theme (like `proj-react-app`). Please make sure to use this branch for submission.
- **Directory Navigation:** Inside your designated branch, you'll find a folder already named and waiting for you. This is where you'll drop your project files.

### Staying Within Your Lane

- **Root Folder:** Please do not change anything in the repository's root folder. Your project belongs in the specific folder within your branch and nowhere else.

### Project and Only Project

- **File Relevance:** Add, commit and push only the files that are part of your assignment. This includes code files and any other materials your instructor has asked for.
- **Keep It Clean:** Avoid adding files that aren't related to your project. We love a clutter-free repository!

### Making Your Commits Count

Naturally, what makes a good commit message is subjective, but here are some guidelines: We want to answer the why as well as the what Our commit messages should serve as documentation right alongside the code that makes life easier for other to read or work with the code. We will follow: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The description MUST be present and the first line MUST NOT exceed 100 characters.

The types we will use are:

- `feat:` - Introducing a new feature
- `fix:` - Squashing those pesky bugs

Examples:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: allow user to delete tasks"
```

```sh
git commit -m "fix: resolve style inconsistencies"
```

### Ready, Set, Merge!

- **Merge Request:** Finished your project? Awesome! Now, create a merge request to move your work into the main branch.
- **Describe Your Journey:** In your merge request, share the story of your assignment. What was challenging? How did you overcome obstacles? This detail helps reviewers understand your process.

### Final Step: Submit Your Work

- **Share Your Merge Request:** Once your merge request is up, grab its link.
- **Official Submission:** Submit the link via our Learning Management System (LMS). It's crucial for making sure your project gets the attention it deserves.

## ðŸ“Œ Remember

- **Deadlines are Key:** Submit on time to avoid penalties or missing out.
- **Original Matters:** Your work must be yours alone, unless properly cited. We take plagiarism seriously.
- **Feedback is Gold:** Look out for commets on your merge request. It's all about learning and improving.

ðŸŽŠ Happy coding! We're excited to see what you create.
